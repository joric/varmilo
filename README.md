# Varmilo VB87M DIY

DIY project for the leftover Varmilo VB87M plastic case

## Video

Since there were no CNC or metal cutting services nearby I used low-power laser to cut plastics.
First batch was unsuccessfull, the laser was misconfigured, switches didn't snap, probably wrong kerf.

## Download

* [varmilo-vb87m-plate.dxf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/varmilo/master/files/varmilo-vb87m-plate.dxf) (latest version, with the spacebar wire cutout)

## Dimensions

* Thickness: 1.5 mm
* Height: 125 mm
* Width: 349 mm
* Path Length: 6354 mm

## Materials

Preferably aluminum, then carbon steel (preferably black, anodized or galvanized)

## Building

I've used [KLE][1] and [Swillkb][2], with a standard TKL layout (with modified 0.5u distance to function keys).
Spacebar wire cutouts were originally removed for rigidity, you can use swillkb to recreate switch cutouts and then use my outlines for the case.

## Laser Cutting Services

* https://lasergist.com apparently doesn't work with sheets larger than 300 mm (60% keyboards only)
* https://laserboost.com wants about 40 EUR for steel and 60 EUR for aluminum (+14 EUR shipping)
