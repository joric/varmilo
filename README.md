# Varmilo VB87M DIY

DIY project for the leftover Varmilo VB87M plastic case

## Plate

Mechanical keyboards need a "plate" it should be rather precise, preferably aluminum.
I've used [KLE][1] and [Swillkb][2], with a standard TKL layout (with modified 0.5u distance to function keys).
Since there's no CNC or powerful lasers nearby I was trying to use low-power laser and cut plastics.
First batch was unsuccessfull (see [imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/HyMhu)), the laser was apparently a little off.
Maybe it would be easier just 3D-print everything, but it needs extra modelling.

### Download

* [varmilo-vb87m-plate.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/varmilo/master/files/varmilo-vb87m-plate.svg)

(My service actually used [.cdr](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joric/varmilo/master/files/varmilo-vb87m-plate.cdr)
but I exported it from CorelDraw to .svg. Check that cutout size is precisely 14mm!)

### Dimensions

* Height: 125 mm
* Width: 349 mm
* Path Length: 5932 mm
* Thickness: 1.5 mm

Spacebar cutouts are removed for rigidity, you can use swillkb to recreate them and use svg outline for case cutouts.

### Materials

Preferably aluminum, then carbon steel (preferably black, anodized or galvanized)

### Laser Cutting Services

* https://lasergist.com apparently doesn't work with sheets larger than 300 mm (60% keyboards only)
* https://laserboost.com wants 40.05 EUR for steel and 62.58 EUR for aluminum (+13.95 EUR shipping)
